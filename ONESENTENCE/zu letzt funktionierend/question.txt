Question

Hello! 

I am new to Chatscript. I am trying to make a Chatbot that (optimally) uses an interface with Postgresql
so I can run a product recommendation. 

I have a few questions: 

1. Is it alright for me to jump from one top file to another by using gambit? For instance, I have the following line:

		a: AFFIRMATIVE (~yes) In diesem Fall kann ich dir dabei helfen, was aus dem Uni-Shop zu suchen, $kunde. gambit(~keyEx)

2. How do I map words that consist of multiple words as one in a concept?
For example, I have:

concept: ~example[word one wordtwo]

In this case, how would I make it so "word 1" is recognized as one unit - instead of being "word" and "1"?
Do I do this by having ~example["word one" wordtwo]

		
3. How do I include an already existing database (PostgresSQL) in ChatScript? So far, we only know how to build it ourselves
but we want to use an exisiting one.  

4. This is the most complicated one I figure -
How exactly would a keyword extraction work in ChatScript? If you've read the other points: I want to run a query 
in a database. My first idea was to find any words that appear in one of my columns (Name, Purpose, Color) and 
build concepts around it. 

Imagine: Say, I have a database for vehcicles called vehicle, with the following columns: Power, Color, Seats

So if my user input was: I want a red car with 2 seats and at least 250 horse power 

my query in postgresql would look like this:

select *
from vehicle 
where power >= 250 and color = 'red' and seats = 2


My approach to this would have been like this: Make a concept for every distinct entry in every column

Like so:

concept: ~colors [green red blue]
concept: ~seats [2 4 6]

The next step to take would be to look for said "keywords" in user input. To be more precise:
The user says what he wants, like "I want a red car with 2 seats and at least 250 horse power". 

Question 1: How do I make the bot look for matching words from the three concepts at the same time?
So in "I want a red car with 2 seats and at least 250 horse power" it would have to look for matching 
words in (~seats) and (~colors). It does not really have to be concepts - I am very new ChatScript and
if there is a better approach to this than using concepts, please let me know.

Question 2: Assuming I get the bot to  match user input with multiple concepts, what 
I'd like to do next is to save said matches in words such as $color and $seats. I've done this 
with $name before but I wonder how that'd be done.
